# TrueCallerScraper
TrueCallerScraper is a Python script that automates the extraction of profile names from the TrueCaller app. It uses ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to interact with the app, captures screenshots, performs OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using pytesseract, and saves the profile names to an output file.
